## Nvidia 的故事
> Confronting our mistake and with humility asking for help, save NVIDIA. These traits are the hardest for the brightest and most successful like yourself.

我们坦诚面对错误、谦卑地寻求帮助，拯救 Nvidia 的存续。这些特质对于像你们这样最聪明、最成功的人而言，是最难养成的。

> We invented CUDA and pioneered accelerated computing and AI. But the journey forged our corporate character to endure the pain and suffering that is always needed to realize a vision.

我们打造了 CUDA 并在加速运算和 AI 领域成为领导者。这段旅程锻造了我们企业的品格，承受痛苦和苦难，是在追求愿景的路上必经之痛。

> Retreat does not come easily to the brightest and most successful people like yourself. Yet, strategic retreat, sacrifice, deciding what to give up, is that a core, the very core of success.

“放弃”对于像你们如此聪明且成功的人来说并不容易。然而，有策略的撤退、牺牲、决定放弃什么不正是成功最重要的核心吗？
